<AutomaticallyRemoveObjectsInTheField>Remove objects automatically_If you are fighting in a siege, there are very many objects, such as weapons and shields. These objects roll a lot on the floor for a very long time. Until I finished the battle with 1150 vs 450, they remained, and I thought that many objects were being calculated and inspected by the game engine. So I added a function to optimize these.</AutomaticallyRemoveObjectsInTheField>

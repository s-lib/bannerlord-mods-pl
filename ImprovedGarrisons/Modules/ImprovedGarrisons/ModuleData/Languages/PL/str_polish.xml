    <string id="tutorial_garrisonbehavior" text="This is the [Improved Garrison Recruitment Behavior Menu] \n \nOptions:\n> Set the maximum amount of troops to recruit.\nYour Improved Garrison will not recruit above the garrisons limits. With this option you can set a custom limit to which the recruitment will stop.\n \n> Recruit Prisoners above threshold\nThis allows the recruitment of prisoners even if the custom recruitment limit has been reached. If you want to recruit prisoners and also recruit nearby recruits your limit will be reached very fast. This would stop both recruitments. Therefore it is adviced to enable recruit prisoners above threshold to still be able to recruit prisoners if you want to." /> <!-- NEW -->

The threshold is calculated with the current garrison size and the current recruiter party size in mind. If this number has been reached, the recruiter will return and no new recruiter will be automatically created if the automatic recruiter establishment is enabled." />   <!-- NEW -->
